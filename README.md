# Advent of Code 2025

This repository  contains my solutions for the Advent of Code 2025 programming challenges written in C++. 

Each day's challenge is implemented in a separate file within the `src` directory.

All common code is under the `include` directory to promote code reuse and maintainability.

Of course there may be better or more efficient solutions out there, but these are my personal attempts to solve the puzzles, without any spoilers or external help.

Following AoC author desires I won't publish any content of the challenges here, like puzzles or input data. Instead I will list every completed puzzle with a link to the corresponding Advent of Code page.
